        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Pawan Thapaliya, a computational neuroscientist with a background in applied physics and a deep passion for understanding the brain through computational models. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Physics Department in Applied Physics, specializing in computational neuroscience at the intersection of neuroinformatics, neuroengineering, and biophysics. My research focuses on developing biologically realistic models to study cellular dynamics and neurovascular coupling, particularly the role of astrocytes in maintaining brain homeostasis.

I am particularly interested in investigating how changes in ion concentrations—specifically sodium and calcium—within astrocytes influence neuronal activity and vascular responses during metabolic stress, such as ischemia, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. By studying astrocytes' role in neurovascular coupling, my goal is to develop a deeper understanding of how these cells coordinate neuronal and blood flow interactions to maintain brain function under stress.

Through my work, I strive to create models that not only deepen our understanding of fundamental brain processes but also contribute to therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. In addition to my research, I apply machine learning, artificial intelligence, and EEG signal analysis techniques to bridge gaps between computational neuroscience and healthcare, with a focus on improving clinical outcomes.

I am excited about leveraging cutting-edge computational tools to develop innovative solutions that can transform our approach to studying the brain and treating neurological diseases.
