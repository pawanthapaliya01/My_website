    <h2>Current Research</h2>
    <p>
        I am a <strong>PhD candidate in Applied Physics</strong> at the University of South Florida, conducting research in <strong>Dr. Ullah's Biophysics Lab</strong>. My work focuses on developing <strong>biophysical models</strong> to explore the intricate dynamics of astrocytes under metabolic stress conditions, particularly during <strong>chemical ischemia</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Using <strong>Markov models</strong>, I simulate ion dynamics—such as sodium and calcium signaling—to understand astrocytic responses during energy deprivation. This research aims to uncover the mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interactions and their implications in neurological disorders like <strong>stroke, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        By combining <strong>computational modeling</strong> with experimental insights, my goal is to contribute to the development of <strong>therapeutic strategies</strong> for neurodegenerative conditions.
